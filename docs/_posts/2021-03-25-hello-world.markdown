## Why did I start this?
Because I had something to say. I was listening to the beautiful [Lex Fridman podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNdhgOk4-fE), and I saw how blockchain could revolutionize the future. To be honest, I don't know much about it. It's quite technical and too big of a world to be explored in this little time. But this episode of Lex's podcast shed light on it. I wanted to share why blockchain is potentially world changing.

## Some comments on Blockchain

# A little "what is blockchain"
Blockchain is a technology that is able to solve some problems that are present in our everyday life. One of them is trust. We usually trust institutions to do things well, even if this does not always happens (see any of the hundred government failures in history). Blockchain does it differently, as people or users do not have to trust an institution, but they have to trust an algorithm. If we have strict rules that are designed so we can't cheat, then we can trust them. I'm finding it very hard to explain. The idea is that algorithms are more trustable than any organization concentrating power.

Here I go again. Blockchain is conformed by a set of algorithms that allow people to create certified (they all agree with it), non-modifiable common knowledge. We can think of it as algorithms that allow us to create a common book, whose contents are unmutable. The knowledge is certified in the sense that the algorithm stablishes a specific way in which each new page of the book is written, a way users accept and know. This book can be used to note down transactions (cryptocurrency), contracts of any kind (even automatically actionable, if they involve code), non-fungible tokens, etc.. 

# The three challenges of these systems
Blockchain is one more system (like payment processing systems) but it is quite ambitious. It tries to get three things at the same time: scalability (fast transaction times, low storage cost), security (it is not easy to cheat) and decentralization (the power is not centralized). Nowadays we usually go for the first two of them, that is, scalable and secure centralized systems. For instance, Visa processing credit card payments. It works well enough, it is not that easy to cheat (create a non-existent transaction in the record), but we have to trust the institution.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is secure and decentralized. It is not easy to create fake bitcoins and transactions are verified. However, it is not scalable today. This is an important point given the hype. To have bitcoin to process the number of transactions we usually want for a currency would imply wasting _too much_ energy. If you go to a bitcoin conference as I did, you will not hear a word about scalability.

Ethereum is like bitcoin, but it does more things than being a cryptocurrency. It's more like a platform for smart contracts with programming language included. Algorand is a company that tries to get hese three challenges solved at the same time.

## What if we tackle them
I think a mental exercise is quite illustrative. For starters, we could live in a world in which the currency is global and not controlled by any government (there will be no money printing and bad monetary policies). Take into account that monetary policies are just one axis of an economic policy, thus the states will be still able to do great (and terrible) things in this realm. In this world in which we have fast, unfalsifiable transactions, with little to none storage and transaction cost, organizations like banks should not be needed anymore (the physical storage part of money).

Of course, investment funds will be able to exist. But they too would be revolutionized. Smart contracts will allow people to easily automate, for instance, a peer to peer lending platform _in which no third party has to be trusted_. This is, open source platforms for investors and by investors will arise and compete by having marginal costs. Moreover, the states will use blockchain all around, as they will be able to automate and certify transactions, payments, bills, etc.. One can even imagine the legal code in a blockchain that is executable! The exciting part of all this is that we could create a big blockchain that controls our society and no individual or small group can fool. Today, the control and power is in little groups of people. Blockchain has some close relation to democracy too.

I've just heard there is a 6% of the global GDP (a ton of money) that is lost in financial friction (mainly third parties). Using blockchain can mean removing all these costs. If you want to sell a house, you won't need a lawyer. If you want to transact with someone in another country and there is no trustable common third party, then use blockchain. Basically, a world in which decentralized (no third parties), secure (no fakeable) and scalable (cheap) records systems are used can have automated lots of thigs. 

It is exciting.
